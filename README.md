# Command-line-Inventory-Application-Project
A new phone store has opened up! Below you will learn the functionality and how to use the new inventory system that is used across the store. Please make sure to read all the information for it relies you as the user to input certain information to fully use it at its full capacity!

## Installation Setup
- Head over to your local terminal
- Create a directory where you will be storing this program
`mkdir directoryName`
- Go inside of the directory
`cd directoryName`
- Git clone this repo by running the command
`git clone "code url"`
- Create the files .gitignore and index.js
`touch .gitignore index.js`
- Create a directory and title it data. For this is where we will store our JSON files
`mkdir data`
`touch cart.json`
`touch phones.json`
- Proceed to create another directory within the main directory and title it src
`mkdir src`
- Within the src directory create a helpers.js and phoneController.js file
`cd src`
`touch helpers.js`
`touch phoneController.js`
- Run the command below since we want to make this into a node project
`npm init -y`
- We will be using a random id number generator through the assistance of nanoid. Run the command below:
`npm install nanoid@3`
- Open up VSCode using the command `code .`

- Once VSCode is opened head over to your `package.json` file. Now you will find a `scripts:` section. Update it and make sure it looks something like this: 
```js
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "index": "node index.js index",
    "create": "node index.js create",
    "show": "node index.js show",
    "update": "node index.js update",
    "destroy": "node index.js destroy",
    "details": "node index.js details",
    "add": "node index.js add",
    "calculate": "node index.js calculate",
    "cancel": "node index.js cancel"
  },
  ```

## Functionality Commands
### Index
The index command will allow you to view the phones along with their respective id's that are kept within the phones.json file
 `npm run index`

**Sample Output:**
> [
  'cD-5 Samsung S23 Ultra',
  'fB-4 iPhone 15 Pro Max',
  'gF-4 Google Pixel 8 Pro',
  'xr7P Motorola Razr+',
  'D50u One Plus 10 Pro',
  'xeG5 Samsung Z-Flip 5'
]

### Details
The details command will allow you to view the details of a specific phone through the use of a phone id. The user will input the command along with the appropriate phoneId.
`npm run details cD-5`

**Sample Output:**
> [
  {
    id: 'cD-5',
    name: 'Samsung S23 Ultra',
    priceInCents: 999,
    color: 'Phantom Black',
    storage: 256,
    inStock: true,
    onSale: true
  }
]

### Create
The create command will allow you to create a phone and add it to the system. It does have a larger amount of user inputs in order to fully process it. Below the example I will be using is the One Plus 10 Pro.
`npm run create "One Plus 10 Pro" 899 Blue 512 true`
After running the command you follow up with the name of the phone. If it has a space you put it into a string format through the use of "". Then you follow up with the retail price which is 899. Then the color which is Blue. Then the storage capacity which is 512. Lastly you enter true or false to show if you have it in stock or not.

**Sample Output:**
> {
    "id": "pESO",
    "name": "One Plus 10 Pro",
    "priceInCents": 899,
    "color": "Blue",
    "storage": 512,
    "inStock": "true",
    "onSale": false
  }
  
You may notice that there is a key value called "id" that was already generated. This is where nanoid autogenerated a random id whenever we create a new phone. Also, there is a key called "onSale" that is preset to false. Further down we'll see why it was preset to false. At the moment this is just the regular price we're displaying
